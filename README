Just some experiments with PHP's traits.
========================================

Traits
------
* GetSet: Automatically handles get/set methods for your class (provided you have created the class member).
* Logger: Class-specific logging within a unified directory & filename structure.
* Singleton: For when you absolutely, positively, can only have 1 of an object. Maybe.
